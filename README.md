# About
This is a fork of Pod's original GitHub project. There are multiple macros that load from separate seed lists and create worlds with them to practice with. 

# How To Use
Open each macro, and set your file directory to your first (or practice) MC instance in MultiMC, along with your reset hotkey. To start runnimg, make sure in taskbar that none of these practice macros are open, and then navigate to the folder you download and load the macro with the seed criteria you want. Load up your selected MC instance, and use your hotkey to generate the next seed. 

# Seed Lists
basicMapless - mapless at spawn, deep ocean, nether fastion

topRuns - updated every once in a while for top run seeds, mainly sub 9:30s
